// What I need to do
    Implement the TA's recursive function
        Here are my notes from that
            object is not null
            instance of trie
            this == 0
            Trie newTrie = (Trie)o;
        Before calling the function, make sure the nodes are not null

    Make the toString work with my past picture
        Track previousChars
            pass in this.previousChars in the makeRecursiveFunction (set root string to be "");
        I don't need to track the number of times it was printed
        Test with the use cases again
